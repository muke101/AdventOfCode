I decided to get into this late and start with a random day, by chance choosing day 15, which as it happens turned out to be the longest, hardest challenge of all AoC challenges thus released.
I did manage to complete it, but it kind of killed my drive to do the rest. None the less, still learnt loads about pathfinding.
